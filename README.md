# Python-APIs

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator by using Python libraries and the OpenWeatherMap API. The WeatherPy shows relationship between the "temperature and city latitude", "humidity and city latitude", "cloudiness and city latitude", "wind speed and city latitude".
